Q) How can you identify the valid and invalid equivalence classes
   and boundary values for a given input or output domain of an
   embedded software component or system -  

In equivalence partitioning, equivalence classes are evaluated for 
given input conditions. Whenever any input is given, then type of 
input condition is checked, then for this input conditions, 
Equivalence class represents or describes set of valid or invalid states. 

Guidelines for Equivalence Partitioning : 

1) If the range condition is given as an input, then one valid and 
   two invalid equivalence classes are defined. 
2) If a specific value is given as input, then one valid and 
   two invalid equivalence classes are defined. 
3) If a member of set is given as an input, then one valid and 
   one invalid equivalence class is defined. 
4) If Boolean no. is given as an input condition, then one valid 
   and one invalid equivalence class is defined.
