Q) How can you use boundary value analysis and equivalence
   class partitioning to test the interoperability and 
   compatibility of an embedded software component or
   system with other components or systems -

Compatibility testing - 
is one of the several types of software testing performed on a 
system that is built based on certain criteria and which has 
to perform specific functionality in an already existing 
setup/environment. Compatibility of a system/application being 
developed with, for example, other systems/applications, OS, 
Network, decide many things such as use of the system/application 
in that environment, demand of the system/application etc.

Interoperability testing - 
involves testing whether a given software program or technology 
is compatible with others and promotes cross-use functionality. 
This kind of testing is now important as many different kinds of 
technology are being built into architectures made up of many 
diverse parts, where seamless operation is critical for developing 
a user base
