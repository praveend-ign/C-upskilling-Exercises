Q) How can you use boundary value analysis and 
   equivalence class partitioning to test the
   robustness and reliability of an embedded 
   software component or system against invalid
   or unexpected inputs or outputs -

Robustness - a term used to describe the ability of a program 
             to resist crashing due to incorrect input or incorrect 
             intermediate results.

robustness testing using Boundary value analysis -

add
 1) value slightly larger than maximum - "max+"
 2) value slightly smaller than minimum - "min-"
    and generate test cases as for BVA.

 example scenario -
What happens if a physical quantity exceeds its maximum?
  - load capacity of an elevator
  - date, e.g. May 32
  - temperature

adding robustness to equivalence class testing -

Equivalence Class testing - classes only for the valid inputs.

Robust Equivalence Class testing - classes for valid inputs & invalid inputs
