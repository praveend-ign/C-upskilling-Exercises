Q) How can you use boundary value analysis and equivalence class
   partitioning to design test cases that cover both 
   functional and non-functional requirements of an
   embedded software component -

Functional testing usually tests the business functionality 
the application under development is intended to solve, whereas 
non-functional testing is done to test user-friendly, 
desirable system requirements of the user.

equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are used
most commonly for functional testing.

by taking more that one input from each partition class,
such that some of the test cases of non-functional testing
could also be covered
