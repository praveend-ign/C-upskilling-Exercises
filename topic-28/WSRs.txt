Weekly Status Report
======================
A weekly status report, also known as a weekly check-in, is a communication tool 
that project managers use to keep tabs on their employeesâ€™ work experiences.

In a daily standup meeting, team members all meet together at the same time 
each day to talk about their completed tasks, future goals and blockers. 
Unlike a daily standup, weekly status reports happen only once a week. 
They are automated, more reflective and are often more emotional but can also 
address project-based concerns as well
