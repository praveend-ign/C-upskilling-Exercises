sprint goal
============
A sprint goal is a brief explanation of what the team plans to achieve 
during the course of an Agile sprint. It is a tangible goal written together 
by the team and Product Owner and is time-bound to the duration of the sprint

sprint goals should be specific and time-bound by the sprint, while still 
adding value to the client. The sprint goal defines your key objective while the 
specific tasks and expected outcomes of the sprint should be outlined by the 
sprint backlog.

effort and complexity of sprint backlog tasks -

1) keep track of its progress and status throughout the sprint
2) The main idea is to visualize the work flow, identify and 
   resolve any impediments, and communicate any changes or issues 
   to the team and stakeholders
3) review and update your sprint backlog regularly, as you complete, 
   add, or modify tasks, or as you receive new feedback or requirements.
