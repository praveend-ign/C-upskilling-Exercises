Cert C coding standard
========================
The SEI CERT Coding Standards are software coding standards developed by the 
CERT Coordination Center to improve the safety, reliability, and security of 
software systems. Individual standards are offered for C, C++, Java, 
Android OS, and Perl.
This coding standard consists of rules and recommendations. 

Q) difference between Rule and Recommendation -

Rules are meant to provide normative requirements for code;
recommendations are meant to provide guidance that, 
when followed, should improve the safety, reliability, 
and security of software systems.

Q) How to avoid buffer overflow vulnerabilities by following ARR30 rule - 

The C Standard identifies the following distinct situations in which 
undefined behavior (UB) can arise as a result of invalid pointer operations:

1) Addition or subtraction of a pointer into, or just beyond, an array object 
   and an integer type produces a result that does not point into, 
   or just beyond, the same array object.
2) Addition or subtraction of a pointer into, or just beyond, an array object 
   and an integer type produces a result that points just beyond the array object 
   and is used as the operand of a unary * operator that is evaluated.
3) An array subscript is out of range, even if an object is apparently accessible 
   with the given subscript, for example, in the lvalue expression a[1][7] given 
   the declaration int a[4][5]).
4) An attempt is made to access, or generate a pointer to just past, a flexible 
   array member of a structure when the referenced object provides no elements 
   for that array.

Q) Benefits of using code sight IDE plugin with coverity for CERT compliance ?

 1) it helps in addressing security defects in real time as we code.
 2) Code Sight quickly and accurately detects security defects in 
    application code and infrastructure-as-code files as you open, edit, and 
    save them, so you can stay focused and fix security bugs before you check in
 3) Code Sight gives you complete visibility into security risks in both direct 
    and transitive open source dependencies, so you can select the most secure 
    components and versions to use and avoid incompatible licenses 
 4) When issues are found, Code Sight shows you exactly what code change or 
    component upgrade is needed, and it can often make the fix automatically 
    for you with just one click.
