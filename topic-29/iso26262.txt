ISO 26262 is an international functional safety standard for the development of 
electrical and electronic systems in road vehicles. It defines guidelines to 
minimize the risk of accidents and ensure that automotive components perform 
their intended functions correctly and at the right time

ISO 26262 provides a comprehensive approach for the functional safety 
of the whole system

ISO 26262 is highly adopted standard is a Functional Safety standard titled 
“Road vehicles – Functional safety”, or: ISO 26262. It applies to passenger 
vehicles up to 3500 kilograms (7716 pounds) and addresses potential safety 
vulnerabilities in electronic and electrical systems, like anti-lock brakes, 
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), engine control units, and
digital instrument clusters.

ISO 26262 includes following phases :-

Planning - In this phase, the safety requirements for the system are 
           defined, and a safety plan is developed.

Analysis - In this phase, the system is analyzed to identify hazards 
           and potential failure modes.

Design and Implementation - In this phase, the system is designed and 
implemented to meet the safety requirements defined in the planning phase 
and to eliminate or mitigate the hazards identified in the analysis phase.

Verification - In this phase, the system is tested to ensure that it meets 
               the safety requirements and that any hazards have been 
               eliminated or mitigated.

Validation - In this phase, the system is tested in its intended environment 
             to ensure that it behaves as expected.

Production, Operation and Decommissioning - In this phase, the safety requirements 
                                   are maintained and the system is decommissioned. 



ISO26262 is basically relying on a use case analysis -


analysis of use cases ----------> Tool impact --------> Tool Error detection ----------> Tool confidence level

Tool impact - If a tool can „introduce or fail to detect“ errors, the tool 
              actually will have an impact on the final product quality. 
              This is then called TI2. If a tool does not play any role 
              regarding the final product quality, there is no tool impact (TI1)

Tool Error detection - The second step in the process is the evaluation of the 
                       tool error detection level. For tools that can have an 
                       impact on the safety of the final product (TI2), we just 
                       need to ask one simple question: Assuming the tool has a 
                       malfunction, what is the likelihood of detecting it later 
                       in the process. If there is a high likelihood (TD1), we don’t 
                       need to have a high confidence in the tool behaving correctly. 
                       If we would not detect a tool malfunction in subsequent 
                       process steps (TD2, TD3), we need to have a high confidence 
                       in the correct tool behavior. 
	
ISO 26262 defines 3 levels of tool confidence

TCL1: This is the lowest tool confidence level. The tool does not play an important 
role regarding the quality of our final product. Therefore, we do not need to have 
a high confidence in the correct tool behavior from an ISO 26262 view. 
A tool qualification is not needed.

TCL2/3: This corresponds to a medium/high tool confidence level. The tool plays an 
important role regarding the quality of our final product, so we need to have a 
certain level of confidence and therefore need to perform a tool qualification 
to demonstrate the reliability of that tool.

Additional notes -

Some of the challenges of implementing ISO 26262 include:

Complexity. The standard is very detailed and covers a wide range of topics, 
            making it difficult to fully understand and implement.

Time and Cost. Meeting the requirements of the standard can be time-consuming and 
               costly, and may require significant changes to existing development processes.

Testing and Validation. Ensuring that a system meets the requirements of the standard 
                        can be challenging, as it may require extensive testing and validation.

Risk Assessment. Identifying and assessing potential hazards and risks can be 
                 difficult, especially in complex systems.

Traceability. Maintaining traceability of requirements and design decisions throughout 
              the development process can be difficult, especially in large and complex projects.

Tool Support. There may be a lack of tool support for certain aspects of the standard, 
              making it difficult to fully automate the compliance process.

Expertise. Having the necessary expertise and resources to fully implement the 
           standard can be a challenge, as it requires specialized knowledge of functional 
           safety and automotive systems.


Benefits of ISO 26262:

It provides detailed guidelines for concurrent development and testing of 
hardware and software, recognizing that they must be tested together to 
achieve optimal safety

Adopting ISO 26262 helps ensure that the safety of car components is 
considered from the beginning of the development process, from initial
risk assessment to final decommissioning
