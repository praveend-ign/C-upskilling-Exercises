ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level)
=========================================
ASIL refers to Automotive Safety Integrity Level. It is a risk classification 
system defined by the ISO 26262 standard for the functional safety of
road vehicles.

There are four ASILs identified by ISO 26262â€•A, B, C, and D. 
ASIL A represents the lowest degree and ASIL D represents the highest degree 
of automotive hazard.

Systems like airbags, anti-lock brakes, and power steering require an 
ASIL-D grade - the highest rigor applied to safety assurance -
because the risks associated with their failure are the highest. 
On the other end of the safety spectrum, components like rear lights 
require only an ASIL-A grade. Head lights and brake lights generally would 
be ASIL-B while cruise control would generally be ASIL-C.

3 variables that are measured to determine the ASIL of a potential hazard -

ASILs are established by performing hazard analysis and risk assessment. 
For each electronic component in a vehicle, engineers measure 
three specific variables:

1) Severity (the type of injuries to the driver and passengers)
2) Exposure (how often the vehicle is exposed to the hazard)
3) Controllability (how much the driver can do to prevent the injury)

ASIL classification dependency on context and interpretation -
